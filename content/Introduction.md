Hi! My name is Zahra and I am a senior college student. I am majoring in Information Communication Technology with a focus in Technology Management. I do not have any experience in content management, but I have learned some web design skills from the web design intro class I took back in my community college. 

My hobbies are painting, jewelry making, and playing keyboard. I made bracelets and earrings during my quarantine summer break. Watercolor and acrylic are my favorite medium for painting. My recent painting is a mix of watercolor and color pencils using wooden stamp tools. The last song I played on my keyboard is "Watermelon Sugar" by Harry Styles.
