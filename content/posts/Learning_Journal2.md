My learning report for the second week of ICT 302 Content Management class:

**I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.**



**I can describe and compare content management systems.**
We didn't learn about the content management system outside of Hugo yet, hence this question is not applicable for this week. 


**I can manage content using established workflows.**



**I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.**



**I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.**
I have compared HTML/CSS coding and the website to puzzle out the purpose of the code pieces such as <strong> and <td> tags in the Explore activity. I went to the Markdown guide websites like this [one](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) to learn the differences between HTML and Markdown coding.
