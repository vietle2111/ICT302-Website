My learning report for the first week of ICT 302 Content Management class:

**I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.**

The main key concept I learn this week is the repository. The GitHub repository stores the important coding files and folders which runs the website's appearance and function   


**I can describe and compare content management systems.**

We haven't done anything related to comparing contentent management systems since we are learning only Hugo for now. 


**I can manage content using established workflows.**

I believe that we are in the infancy stage of learning to establish workflow. In my learning experiance, I follow step-by-step in launching the website by using both GitHub and Netlify. I also fix the sample post error by learning to edit files in GitHub repository.  


**I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.**

I have a basic understanding about Hugo content mangement system after completing assignments. I learn that Netlify and GitHub are seperate from Hugo but are interconnected since they are in the same content mangement system. 


**I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.**

While creating my first learning report here, I have learned to format text by making some sentences bold which is evident here. I have found this useful [GitHub guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) while researching on my own about making the text bold in Hugo website. I did a self-directed learning because I want to add some style to my post.
